          <font color=grey>Welcome to the SpiritMeal Program:</font>
          <hr width="730" color="#FFAA55"></p>

           <p>This program is aimed at making the word of God available to you
           on your personal computer and also taking the pain out of reading the Bible. You will therefore
           find articles that might inspire your interest in the word. A King James 
           Dictionary has also been provided just in case the "thee" "thine" "thou"s become a problem. The 
           program is meant to be distributed free of charge to any person who might want to consider the 
           word of God in his life. Have fun!</p>

           <p><u><a name="Bible">Bible study and scripture look-up:</a></u> Look up a scripture in the bible by first choosing the book from the book menu. You can then select the chapter and the verse to go a specific part of the book.<br><br>           

           <u><a name="word">Word or scripture searching:</a></u>
           SpiritMeal has a search utility for searching words or scriptures in all or specific parts of the bible.
           <br><br>

           <u><a name="king">The King James Dictionary:</a></u>
           The sole purpose of this Dictionary is to deliver the meanings of archaic words of more
           than 400yrs ago, in modern English. You might therefore not find the meanings of all
           words in the Bible. </p>

           <p>There are two ways of using the King James Dictionary. You can proceed by highlighting 
           the word that you would like to look-up from the Bible and then launching the Dictionary 
           from the Menu. If the word was found in the Dictionary it would automatically be looked-up 
           and the results displayed. However, if the word was not found you would have the default 
           look of the Dictionary. In that case you may have to manually type in the word to see if
           there are other matches. The second mode of using the Dictionary is by launching it from the 
           Menu and clicking the appropriate word from the list provided. You can also manually type 
           the word into the text-input at the top of the Panel, the list to the left will
           display the list of words matching your search. </p>
